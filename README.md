## New in v1.8

* New milliseconds support for greater accuracy
* Choose from 10 different `time formats` to display as much or as less detail on the key as needed. ðŸ”¥
* New `File Title Prefix` setting allows to set chosen text before the time when saved to file (great to show some text before the time on stream!)

## New in v1.7
*Our faithful Stopwatch plugin coming back with a much needed overhaul:*
- Visual indication if the stopwatch is running or stopped
- User-Customizable images for Enabled/Paused states
- New `Shared Id` feature allows you to view and control the same stopwatch from different profiles and keys
- Multi-Action support (works great with the use of Shared Ids)
- Backend logic improved to keep much more accurate time keeping when running for very long periods of times

## Current functionality
- New: Long press (2 seconds) on the key to reset the stopwatch
- Multiple Stopwatches suppport
- Stopwatches now continue to count even when moving between Stream Deck profiles. 
- Stopping/Starting a watch
- Option to not reset the watch after it's restarted
- Two display styles
- `Shared Id` feature allows you to view and control the same stopwatch from different profiles and keys

## Change Log


## New in v1.6
- `Clear file on reset` mode is awesome for making the text "Disappear" from the stream on reset
- :new: `Lap Mode` - Every press records the timestamp when pressed. A long press will reset the timer and copy all the laps to the clipboard (`Ctrl-V` to see them)

## New in v1.5
- Time is written to a file of your choice so you can display the elapsed time on your stream
- File is now created immediately when you press the "Save" button
